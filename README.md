octetstream - A streaming interface which delivers octets (8-bit) one at a time, or in buffers.  Has an iterator.  This is a base for building up other stream types.  It has a peek() feature, and getPositionPointer, which allows you go get a pointer as a particular position.

cctype - some common character categorization functions

enum - convenience two way dictionary

funkit - some functional programming stuff for iterators

textreader - can read 'lines' based on common end of line delimeters

wordplay - some experiments in iterators


The test directory 

There are some experiments in scanners here.  They leverage the octetstream mostly.

gcode - gcode_repl, gcode_rewriter, gcode_scanner

lox - lox_scanner, lox_lexer, lox_bnf

mmap - memory mapped file handling

spairs - sorting dictionary
